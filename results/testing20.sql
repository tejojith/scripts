We are given a context with schema definitions and transformation logic for an ETL process.
 The query request is to validate the data in the target database using the transformation logic.

 Steps to validate:
 1. We need to check that the transformations from source to target are correctly reflected in the target tables.
 2. Since the transformation logic includes several inserts, we can validate by checking for consistency between source and target.

 However, note that the transformation logic is provided as a series of SQL insert statements. 
 We cannot directly run these to validate because they are designed to load data, not to check it.

 Instead, we can write queries that compare the source and target tables for each dimension or fact table.

 Let's break down the validation by each table:

 - Customers: Check that all distinct customers from raw_orders (source) are present in the target customers table.
   Also, check that there are no extra columns or missing constraints.

 - Sales Channels: Similarly, check distinct channels from source.

 - Payment Methods: Check distinct payment methods from source.

 - Shipping Methods: Check distinct shipping methods from source.

 - Product Categories: Check that the categories and descriptions from raw_products (source) match in target.

 - Products: We have two sources for products? Actually, the transformation logic uses raw_products and product_categories.
   We can check:
     a. The product names in target should be the same as in source.
     b. The category_id in target should map to existing categories in product_categories (but note that the insert into products does not use the category id from the source, it just uses the distinct name and description from raw_products? Actually, no: the product table is loaded by joining raw_products with product_categories on category_name = name. So we must ensure that for each product, there is a matching category.

 - Warehouses: Check distinct warehouses from raw_inventory (source).

 - Inventory: This is loaded by joining raw_inventory and products. We can check:
     a. The product_id in target should exist in the products table.
     b. The warehouse_id should exist in warehouses.
     c. The quantity might be set to 0 or taken from raw_inventory? In the transformation, it's set to 0 for products that are not found? Actually, no: the inventory insert uses raw_inventory and then joins with products and warehouses. But note: the raw_inventory table has a row for each inventory record, and we are joining on sku (source) equals product name (target). So if there is an inventory record in source that does not have a matching product in target, it won't be inserted? Actually, the transformation logic says:

        INSERT INTO target_database.inventory (product_id, warehouse_id, quantity)
        SELECT 
            p.product_id,
            w.warehouse_id,
            ri.quantity
        FROM source_database.raw_inventory ri
        JOIN target_database.products p ON ri.sku = p.name
        JOIN target_database.warehouses w ON ri.warehouse_name = w.name;

     So we must check that every row in raw_inventory (source) has a matching product and warehouse.

 - Sales Orders: This is loaded by joining raw_orders with customers, shipping_methods, payment_methods, and sales_channels.
   We can check:
     a. The customer_id should exist in the target customers table for each order.
     b. The shipping_method_id should exist in shipping_methods (but note that shipping_methods has method_name, so we might have to check by name? Actually, the transformation uses the method_name from raw_orders and maps to shipping_methods.method_name to get the id. So we must ensure that the shipping method names in source are present in target shipping_methods.

   Similarly for payment_method_id and channel_id.

 - Sales Order Items: This is loaded by joining raw_order_items with products and sales_orders.
   We can check:
     a. The product_id should exist in the products table.
     b. The order_id should exist in the sales_orders table.

 - Invoices: Loaded by joining raw_invoices with sales_orders. Check that invoice_id exists in sales_orders? Actually, no: the invoice_id is from raw_invoices and we are inserting into invoices (target) using the order_id to join. But note: the transformation for invoices uses raw_invoices and then joins on order_id. So we must check that every invoice in source has a matching order in target.

 - Payments: Loaded by joining raw_payments with invoices. Check that invoice_id exists in invoices (target) and that the amount_paid and payment_date are consistent.

 However, note that the transformation logic does not guarantee that all data from source is present in target because of joins and distinct operations. We must check for completeness and consistency.

 Since we cannot run the ETL again, we can write queries to:

 1. Check for missing keys (e.g., if a customer exists in raw_orders but not in target customers).
 2. Check for data integrity (e.g., foreign keys) by ensuring that the referenced rows exist.
